Acetaminophen is a commonly used medication that is classified as an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). It is also known by its brand name, Tylenol.

Acetaminophen works by blocking the production of certain chemicals in the body that cause pain and fever. It is often used to treat mild to moderate pain, such as headaches, toothaches, menstrual cramps, and arthritis. It can also be used to reduce fever associated with various illnesses.

Acetaminophen is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, and syrups. The recommended dosage and frequency of use can vary depending on the individual's age, weight, and underlying health conditions. It is important to follow the instructions provided by the healthcare provider or the medication label.

Acetaminophen is generally considered safe when used as directed. However, excessive use or overdose can cause serious liver damage and other health problems. Therefore, it is important to avoid taking more than the recommended dose and to avoid combining acetaminophen with other medications that contain acetaminophen or with alcohol.
