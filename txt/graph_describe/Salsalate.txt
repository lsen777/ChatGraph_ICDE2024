Salsalate is a medication that belongs to the class of salicylates, which are compounds that have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. It is commonly used to treat mild to moderate pain and inflammation associated with conditions such as arthritis.

Salsalate works by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX), which reduces the production of prostaglandins that cause pain and inflammation. Unlike aspirin, salsalate does not have antiplatelet effects and therefore does not increase the risk of bleeding.

Salsalate is available in tablet form and is typically taken orally. It may have side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, and headache. Salsalate should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers, and should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment.
