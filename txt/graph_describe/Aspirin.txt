Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, is a commonly used medication that belongs to the class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It has analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and is also a type of antiplatelet drug that can reduce platelet aggregation and prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Aspirin works by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX), which reduces pain and discomfort caused by inflammation. However, aspirin may also have side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and allergic reactions, and should be used with caution under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
